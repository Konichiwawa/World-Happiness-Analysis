# World Happiness Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this project is to conduct an exploratory analysis of the World Happiness Report data to understand the impact of various factors such as GDP, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption on a country's happiness.

## Data
The data represents survey results from numerous countries between 2015 and 2019. This open-source dataset is available on Kaggle, a public online data repository. The analysis also incorporates a GeoJSON shapefile for spatial analysis using Python's folium library, as well as GDP percentage change data for the United States to conduct a time-series analysis.

## Tools
- Python/Jupyter Notebook: Utilized for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization.
- Tableau: Used to create a comprehensive storyboard that presents key charts and insights relevant to the projectâ€™s findings.
